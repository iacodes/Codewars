/*
Strong number is the number that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself.

For example, 145 is strong, since 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not and return either "STRONG!!!!" or "Not Strong !!".

Notes
Number passed is always Positive.
Return the result as String
